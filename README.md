This app is a small flight booker project with deliverables outlined here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flight-booker

A user will be able to choose where they are flying out of on what day, find all flights or that day, and book a flight somewhere else.

Flights will keep track of how many users have booked that flight in comparison to their capacity. (might add overbooking, since it's a legitimate thing airlines do)

Airports will keep track of what flights are supposed to come in and what flights are supposed to be leaving.

Users will have payment info linked to their account in a different database table, as well as address information in a different table.
